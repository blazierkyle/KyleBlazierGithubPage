# Kyle Blazier's Github Page

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer who has a passion for iOS Development!

I love keeping myself occupied with various apps, whether it be creating a new one or refactoring apps I've previously made.

I hope to contribute to more repositories and continue working on apps in the near future!
